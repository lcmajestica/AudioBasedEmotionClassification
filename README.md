# AudioBasedEmotionClassification
The project was done using Deep Learning Algorithm (CNN). 
This model can classify the input wav file into Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Calm, Surprise, Disgust, and fear.
The model was trained on 4 datasets - RAVDESS, SAVEE, CREMA & TESS and the training data was divided based on female features and male features.
It works real-time too. You have to save the file and upload it in the sign-up page after logging in.
